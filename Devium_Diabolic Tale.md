## Introduction:
  Creating a digital marketplace to address the lack of awareness among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) regarding available trade finance and credit products. The platform will facilitate interaction between SMEs, banks, insurance companies, credit agencies, and marketplace lenders. Trade financiers can list their products and services online, complete with basic terms and contracts, allowing SMEs to easily access and apply for them. Additionally, SMEs can post their trade finance needs along with contact information and credit scoring. 
The platform aims to enhance reliability and visibility in cross-border trades by leveraging blockchain technology. A mobile solution will be integrated to enable tracking, settlement, and confirmation of trade flows.
